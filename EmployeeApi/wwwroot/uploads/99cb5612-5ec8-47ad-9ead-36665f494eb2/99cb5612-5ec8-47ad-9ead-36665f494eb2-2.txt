Demo Project for ASP.NET Developer 
Project Title: 
Student Registration and Report Generation System with Login and CAPTCHA 
Objective: 
To assess the candidate’s practical understanding of ASP.NET development, authentication 
implementation, form validation, data management, and dynamic report generation. 
Project Overview: 
The candidate is required to develop a web-based application in ASP.NET (Core or Framework as per 
choice) using C# / Vb.Net, with the following major components: 
1. Login Page with CAPTCHA Verification 
2. Student Registration Form 
3. Validation Rules (Server-Side and Client-Side) 
4. Report Generation based on specified logic 
Modules and Functional Requirements: 
1. Login Page with CAPTCHA  A simple login page with username and password fields.  CAPTCHA: Generate a random 6-character alphanumeric CAPTCHA (e.g., X7P2Z1).  CAPTCHA should include both upper/lowercase alphabets and numbers.  CAPTCHA should refresh on page reload or click on a refresh icon.  User must enter the CAPTCHA correctly to log in.  Hardcoded credentials can be used (e.g., admin/admin123) for demo purposes.
